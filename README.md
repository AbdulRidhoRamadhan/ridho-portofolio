# Ridho's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, created to showcase my projects and skills. I built it not only to display my work but also as a learning experience to dive deeper into web development, incorporating sleek animations with GSAP and Framer Motion.

## Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Learning Journey

I have spent almost 2 weeks learning and implementing these technologies. This project has been a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of web development, particularly in the areas of animation and styling. The decision to use Sass over other CSS solutions was intentional, as it helped me:

1. Strengthen my understanding of core CSS concepts
2. Learn proper stylesheet organization and architecture
3. Master responsive design principles
4. Understand CSS preprocessing and its benefits
5. Build maintainable and scalable styling systems

For the best experience, we recommend viewing this portfolio on a desktop or laptop.
