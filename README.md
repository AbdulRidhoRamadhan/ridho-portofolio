# Ridho's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This platform is a reflection of my projects, skills, and growth as a developer. Itâ€™s not just a showcase but also a milestone in my journey to mastering web development, where I explored creating seamless animations using GSAP and Framer Motion.

## Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Learning Journey

This project represents two weeks of focused learning and experimentation. Throughout this process, I gained a deeper understanding of web development concepts, particularly in animation, design systems, and responsive styling. I chose Sass as the primary CSS solution to achieve the following:

1. Strengthen my understanding of core CSS concepts
2. Learn proper stylesheet organization and architecture
3. Build responsive, mobile-first designs.
4. Understand CSS preprocessing and its benefits
5. Build maintainable and scalable styling systems

For the best experience, I recommend exploring this portfolio on a desktop or laptop.

## References Design & Inspiration

The design and aesthetic of this portfolio were heavily inspired by the incredible work of [Dennis Nellenberg](https://dennissnellenberg.com/). His creative approach to interactive elements served as a foundation for many of the design decisions I implemented.
